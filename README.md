# grinds-my-gears

Sometimes I can get distracted by things that upset me. They can be little things or they can be big things, but no matter what size, they can derail my day if I let them. So I have decided that when something bothers me, I will write it down, and then get back to work. 

If successful, this list will grow slowly, because I want to spend my time and energy on things that are meaningful to me, things I want to see succeed.
